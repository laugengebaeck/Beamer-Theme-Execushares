# Beamer-Theme-Execushares

A minimalist and modern Beamer theme. Blog post regarding how this was written can be found here: http://hamaluik.com/posts/better-beamer-themes/

## My changes to the original Execushares

* ExecusharesRed is now the blue tone used in [the Gemini beamerposter theme](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini) because it looks better for my use case.
* I developed a solution to show the title page with the `\titlepage` command (and not based on the slide number). Just call the command outside of a frame environment and it will show the title page.
